** Summary

The package libbasecampel is an Emacs library to interact with
[[https://basecamp.com][Basecamp]], a project management web application.

** Authentication

To make libbasecampel work, you first have to give it access to your
Basecamp account. This is done through OAUTH2. If you already have a
client id and secret, skip the next section. Otherwise, keep reading.

*** Obtaining a client id and secret

Login to [[https://basecamp.com/]] and register an application at
[[https://launchpad.37signals.com/integrations]]. You can use whatever
values you want but you should at least:

- check "Basecamp 3" in the "Products" section;
- set the redirect URI as "http://localhost:9321". You can use a
  different port if you want to.

You'll be assigned a client id and client secret. Save that somewhere
so you can skip this step next time.

*** Authenticating

You have a client id, client secret and port number for the redirect
URI (default is 9321).
